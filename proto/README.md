Prototyping topics overview
===========================

This directory contains folders, organized by topic, which together represent
nearly all of the prototyping work which was done in the summer of 2014 by
the DSSG energy fellows. In its current, unfiltered form, it can be difficult
to navigate. A curated set of iPython notebooks which cover a small percentage
of the prototyping done here is available in the
[tutorials](https://github.com/dssg/wikienergy/tree/master/docs/tutorials)
directory.


Topics
------
- Appliance Detection:
  - [`pylearn2`](https://github.com/dssg/wikienergy/tree/master/proto/pylearn2):
    Appliance detection (specifically electric vehicle); `pylearn2` dataset
    creation and manipulation, model loading and saving.

Algorithms
----------
- Hidden Markov Models:
  - [`HMM`](https://github.com/dssg/wikienergy/tree/master/proto/HMM):
    HMM implementations and testing
  - [`FHMM`](https://github.com/dssg/wikienergy/tree/master/proto/FHMM):
    Factorial HMM implementations and testings.
- Neural Networks:
  - [`pylearn2`](https://github.com/dssg/wikienergy/tree/master/proto/pylearn2):
    Appliance detection (specifically electric vehicle); `pylearn2` dataset
    creation and manipulation, model loading and saving.
  - [`NN`](https://github.com/dssg/wikienergy/tree/master/proto/NN):
    Backpropagation algorithm implementation, pybrain testing.
- Support Vector Machines:
