##Algorithms

###Hidden Markov Model (HMM)

-  Develop appliance instance parameters using hidden markov models
    *   z<sub>t</sub>(discrete variable) corresponds to one of K states (state1=on, state2=off)
    *   x<sub>t</sub> (continous variable) is amount of power > 0 (e.x. 100 W)
    *   Hidden Markov Parameters:
        *   Initial Probabilities (&alpha;)
        *   Transition matrix (C) (probability of transition between hidden states)
        *   Emission variables (&phi;) â€“ Gaussian-Gamma, hyperparameters: 
            *   mean, precision, shape, scale
        *   Observed Data (power values, other features)
        *   Hidden States (ON or OFF)
    *  Can be used to generate sample data, predict states, evaluate likelihood
    *  Often used for modeling probabalistic temporal processes
    *  Limited ability to model periodic signals
    *

###Factorial Hidden Markov Model (FHMM)
*  combines several hidden markov models in parallel
*   state space comprises all possible combinations of appliance states

###Neural Networks
* Used for semi-supervised and supervised learning
* Good for modeling non-linear functions
* Mimics biological neurons
* Multiple layers of neurons
* Each neuron applies a sigmoidal function to the weighted sum of the activations of its input neurons

###Accomplishments
* Made HMM appliance models using Tracebase data
* Made training data for FHMMs using appliance models
* Disaggregated Tracebase test data
* Used HMM models to train a neural network
 
###Challenges
* Detecting appliance existence 
* Encoding time in FHMMs
* Understand Step Variant Convolutional Neural Networks

##Analysis 
###Most Common Appliances in Homes
* Ask for suggestions

###Percent HVAC 
*Historically Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning have consumed over half of all home energy. Nationwide the fraction of energy consumed by HVAC has gone done from 58% in 1993 to 48% in 2009, but the number is still large. In intense climates the percent used by HVAC can be even larger, in research done by Pecan Street HVAC demanded 82% of the energy of some homes. Here is what we found:

![October](images/Percent_Hvac_10.png)

###Weather
* Sanity check for Heat and AC use, by looking at correlation
* Created an API which returns minute interval weather data(temp) by zip code
    * This allows us to embed weather information in future models 

####Usage
Use `get_weather_data(api_key,city,state,start_date,end_date)` to query historical weather data. The function will return a JSON object. To query live weather data, use `get_current_temp(city,state, zipcode = None)`.
####January Temperature

###EV
After speaking with Pecan Street we learned that there is need for a way to reliably classify an electric vehicle opposed to another large load, such as HVAC. We've started exploring the homes with EV data looking for the signatures of these cars.
