Energy Disaggregation
=====================

Energy efficiency makes up over half of the potential carbon reduction that
the world needs to combat climate change. However, individual homeowners are
often left in the dark as to what actions they can take to permanently reduce
their energy use while maintaining the same quality of life. This project is
focused on building open-source tools for smart meter data that will make it
easier for homeowners to know what actions they can take to reduce their energy
use. It will use the largest database of smart meter data available to
researchers through a partnership with Pecan Street, a nonprofit based out of
Austin, Texas with a mission to make energy efficiency easy and affordable
for every American.
