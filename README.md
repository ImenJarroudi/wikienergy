Disaggregator
-------------
This repository contains a set of tools for performing end-to-end
disaggregation of single-point energy signals at a low-resolution timescale of
15 minutes, including algorithms for supervised and unsupervised classification
of streaming signals. For a set of tools designed for evaluating and measuring
the effectiveness of new algorithms, please instead use
[nilmtk](https://github.com/nilmtk/nilmtk/) (Non-Intrusive Load
Monitoring Toolkit), which is designed with the needs of researchers in mind.


How to use this toolkit
-----------------------
Quick-start documentation and iPython notebook tutorials can be found in the
[docs](https://github.com/dssg/wikienergy/tree/master/docs) directory.

Background
----------
Energy efficiency makes up over half of the potential carbon reduction that
the world needs to combat climate change. However, individual homeowners are
often left in the dark as to what actions they can take to permanently reduce
their energy use while maintaining the same quality of life. This project is
focused on building open-source tools for smart meter data that will make it
easier for homeowners to know what actions they can take to reduce their energy
use. It will use the largest database of smart meter data available to
researchers through a partnership with Pecan Street, a nonprofit based out of
Austin, Texas with a mission to make energy efficiency easy and affordable
for every American.
