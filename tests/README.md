Tests
=====

How to run the tests
--------------------

The entire test suit can be run using the following command:

    python -m unittest discover

If you wish to test an individual set of cases, as running all tests can be
fairly time consuming, use the following:

    python -m unittest filename

If you wish to execute or write tests with greater specificity, see the full
documentation (linked below).

Information
-----------

We use python's builtin `unittest` module, documentation for which can be found
[here](https://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html).
